                FORCOACH (&ldquo;FORCOACH&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;,
                &ldquo;us&rdquo;) provides a scheduling, earnings, and
                invoicing tool for independent fitness instructors who teach
                across multiple studios. This policy explains what
                information we collect through forcoach.io and the FORCOACH
                web application, how we use it, and the choices you have.

              <h2>1. Information we collect</h2>
              <p>We collect information in the following ways:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Account information</strong> you provide directly:
                  name, email address, password (stored securely by our
                  authentication provider, never in plain text), time zone,
                  and currency preference.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Studio and schedule data</strong> you enter
                  yourself: studio names, contact details, compensation
                  rates, and class/session details (title, date, time,
                  location, notes).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Schedule data you import</strong>, either by
                  uploading a CSV file or by connecting a Google Calendar
                  account (see Section 2 below for how Google data
                  specifically is handled).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Usage information</strong> collected automatically,
                  such as log data needed to operate and secure the service
                  (e.g. request timestamps, error logs). We do not use
                  third-party advertising trackers or sell any data to
                  advertisers.
                </li>

              <h2>2. Google Calendar data specifically</h2>
              <p>
                If you choose to connect Google Calendar, FORCOACH requests
                read-only access
                (<code>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly</code>)
                to a calendar you select. We use this access solely to:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  List the calendars available in your Google account so you
                  can choose which one to sync from.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Read event details (title, start/end time, location,
                  description) from the calendar you select, in order to
                  create matching class entries inside FORCOACH.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>FORCOACH&apos;s use and transfer of information received from Google APIs adheres to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the Limited Use requirements.</p>
              <p>Specifically:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  We <strong>never write to, modify, or delete</strong>{" "}
                  anything in your Google Calendar. Access is read-only.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Google data is used exclusively to display and manage your
                  class schedule inside FORCOACH. We do not use it for
                  advertising, and we do not sell it or share it with any
                  third party.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We do not use Google user data to train generalized AI or

                </li>
                <li>
                  You can disconnect Google Calendar at any time from the
                  Calendar page inside the app, which stops future syncing.
                  You can also fully revoke FORCOACH&apos;s access at any
